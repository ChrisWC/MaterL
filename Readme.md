# ABOUT
This is an implementation of google's material specification and is intended to be used
with the react-starter-kit. The code is unstable and many features have not been fully 
implemented. This code is being developed along side other code. Please also note that 
documentation, including code headers, have not yet been updated (though I'll get around 
to it shortly).


# COMMANDS
Run development server with code sample
`npm start`
Package non-sample code with npm
`npm run pack`
